# Happliy Unmarried Interview Assignment-

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is my Submission to the Assignment I was asked to complete for Happily unmarried(Ustraa)

# functionalities that were expected-

[A] Category tabs: Ustraa categories are displayed as tabs, which can be scrolled horizontally.
Each tab has a different background image. Whenever a category is clicked on, its products
should be shown in the content below.
Additionally, on both left and right ends, there is a “View All” button. Clicking on this button takes
user to a different activity. (Not part of the scope.)

[B] Product list: Below the tabs, a list of products belonging to the selected category are
shown.

[C] Product objects: In the scope of this assignment, only the following product information has
to be displayed in the UI:
● Product image
● Product name
● Product weight (gm/ml)
● Product MRP
● Product special price
● Product rating
● “ADD TO CART” button if product is in stock (click handler is not part of the scope)
● “OUT OF STOCK” button if product is not in stock (no action to be performed on click)
Refer to this image for more information:

[D] The “[+] View More” button: Initially, only 3 products should be shown. Clicking on this
button should reveal all the remaining products in the list. When expanded, this button should
change to “[-] View Less” & clicking on it should bring the product list back to its initial state.

[E] Selected category & the “change” button: The row below the product list shows the
selected category name and a “change” button. Clicking on this button should open a
drop-down like dialog as shown below. Clicking on any of the categories should switch to the
respective category tab & dismiss the dialog.
